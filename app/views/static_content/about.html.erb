<div class='about'>
  <p>I wanted to make a little Rails 4 app from scratch and also try to impliment Twitter bootstrap based on some straight-forward instructions. Don't abuse the site and we'll all be fine.</p>
  <p>Question: Does "of-the-day" imply a daily update?<br>
    Answer: It does not. What it does mean is that the content of the fill in should be topical and varying on a regular basis.</p>
  <a href="/", class="btn btn-large">Back</a>
